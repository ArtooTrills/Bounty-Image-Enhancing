Bounty-Image-Enhancing
======================

CamScanner (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intsig.camscanner) is an app that uses our mobile camera to scan(take a picture of) all kinds of paper documents. It then optimize the scan quality of the image taken to ensure for clear and sharp images with premium color and resolutions. Your task is to do similar type of Image Processing using OpenCV. You are free to use any openCV library you like.

You need to process the image by these three steps-
- _Smart Cropping_: Identify edges of the image taken and hence form a boundary around the image. Now crop the image to retrieve the image inside the boundary only.
- _Auto Enhancing_: Enhance the image to make it more clear and sharp. The idea is to ensure the clarity of text and graphics in the image.
- _Straightning_: You need to straighten the final image by adjusting corner angles and image orientation.
 
Here is an image demonstrating the result of these three steps -

You are free to add more features by yourself to provide for better scanning experience. Sample input and output using CamScanner app is available in the ip and op folders respectively. You can take a look at the CamScanner demo available on the play store link given above. You might also want to download the CamScanner app and see for yourself how it works.
